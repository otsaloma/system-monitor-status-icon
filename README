system-monitor-status-icon is a CPU and memory usage monitor implemented
as a status icon. It's an unambitious experiment that should work in
GNOME 3 fallback mode out of the box, in GNOME 3 proper using some
extension that relocates the status icon and all other desktops,
although the icon size and background color may need adjustment.

system-monitor-status-icon requires python 3.2 or greater [1],
psutil 0.4.0 or greater [2] and pygobject 3.0.0 or greater [3].
