system-monitor-status-icon
==========================

system-monitor-status-icon is a CPU and memory usage monitor implemented
as a status icon. Depending on your desktop environment, this might or
might not work. With GNOME 3 it seems not to work since 3.8 or so as the
icon updating no longer works. Also depending on your desktop
environment the icons might or might not require modifications to their
sizes. Icons can be easily generated with the provided R scripts.

system-monitor-status-icon requires Python 3.2 or greater [1],
psutil 0.4.0 or greater [2] and PyGobject 3.0.0 or greater [3].
