system-monitor-status-icon is a CPU and memory usage monitor implemented
as a status icon. It's an unambitious experiment that should work in
GNOME 3 fallback mode out of the box, in GNOME 3 proper using some
extension that relocates the status icon and probably other desktops as
well. Depending on the desktop, icons may require modification to size
and colors. 16x16 seems to work with GNOME 3 fallback mode and 24x24
(using wide margins) with GNOME 3 proper. Icons can be easily generated
with the provided R scripts.

system-monitor-status-icon requires python 3.2 or greater [1],
psutil 0.4.0 or greater [2] and pygobject 3.0.0 or greater [3].
